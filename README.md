# Sampling Methods to speed up Clustering Algorithms

- The directory structure is as follows -
- There are 4 directories for each clustering algorithm
- Each directory contains 8 files for each sampling method for each dataset Worms and KDD
- Kmedoid directory contains only single file because it is performed on artificial dataset
- K-medoid clustering algorithm is highly expensive in runtime
